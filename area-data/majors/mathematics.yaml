    Basic & Transitions & Perspectives & Level III & Sequence & Electives &
    seven courses from (Transitions, Perspectives, Level III, Sequence, Electives) &
    at most two courses from children where { department != MATH }


Basic:
    Calculus I: MATH 120
    Calculus II: MATH 126 | 128
    Linear Algebra: MATH 220

    result: all of ( Calculus I, Calculus II, Linear Algebra )


Transitions:
    two of ( MATH 242, 244, 252 )


Perspectives:
    description: One course from each of three of the four perspectives.

    # MATH 230, Real, can only count for one of the perspectives,
    # but it can count for both Perspectives and Electives.
    A: one of (MATH 252, 352, 356)
    C: one of (MATH 244, 226, 230, 262, 340, 344)
    D: one of (MATH 232, (238 | 239), 262, CSCI 231, MATH 264)
    M: one of (MATH 242, 230, 236, 262, 266, (STAT 212 | 214 | 272), STAT 316, MATH 330)

    result: three of (A, C, D, M)


Electives:
    any of (
        MATH 226, 230, 232, 236, (238 | 239), 262, 266, 2XX,
        (STAT 212 | 214 | 272), STAT 316,
        CSCI 231,
        (CHEM 371 | ECON 385 | (PHYS 374 | 375 | 376))
    )


Level III:
    description: Two Level III courses, at least one of which must be a Mathematics course.

    filter: only courses from (
            MATH 330, 340, 344, 348, 351, 356,
                 364, 382, 384, 390, 396, 398,
            STAT 322,
            CSCI 315, 333
        )

    result:
        two courses from filter &
        one course from filter where { department = MATH } &
        one course besides MATH 390 from filter


Sequence:
    description: A 200-300-level sequence of two courses, at least one of which must be a Mathematics course.

    Differential Equations: MATH 230 & 330
    Complex Analysis:       MATH 226 & 340
    Real Analysis:          MATH 244 & 344
    Topology:               MATH 224 & 348
    Abstract Algebra:       MATH 252 & 352
    Geometry:               MATH 220 & 356
    Combinatorics:          MATH 232 & 364

    result: one of (
        Differential Equations,
        Complex Analysis,
        Real Analysis,
        Topology,
        Abstract Algebra,
        Geometry,
        Combinatorics )
