	// formally as soon as possible by submitting a completed declaration of
	// major form to the Music Department office. Subsequent changes are

	// Of the credits counting toward the minimum requirements for a major, a

	// NOTE: Ignored, because we don't store grades.

	// No courses explicitly required for a B.M Music major may be taken S/U.
	// NOTE: Ignored, because we don't store s/u status.

	// At least 50 percent of the minimum major must be taken through St.
	// Olaf. Students should consult the registrar and the department chair or
	// program director about counting toward a major courses taken at other
	// colleges. In addition to the registrar, the chair must sign the
	// studentâ€™s transfer of credit form (available from the Office of the
	// Registrar and Academic Advising) if work from other institutions is
	// accepted in advance. Likewise, courses taken through St. Olaf off-
	// campus programs must be approved by the chair or director and the off-
	// campus program advisor in advance if credit toward a major is sought.
	// (See TRANSFER OF CREDIT TO ST. OLAF )
	// NOTE: Ignored, because this doesn't know about major requirements.
