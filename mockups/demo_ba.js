	// interdisciplinary programs may require comprehensive examinations or
	// special research projects. (See Majors, Concentrations, and Areas of
	// Emphasis.) Consult the department or interdisciplinary program listing
	// in this catalog for specific major requirements. Students must declare
	// one major no later than the time of registration for Interim and spring
	// semester of their junior year by filling out a form available at the
	// Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising. Students are allowed to
	// change this declaration or add a second major at a later date. Only
	// this catalog defines the specific requirements for each departmental or
	// interdisciplinary major.

	// Other regulations are:

	// Of the credits counting toward the minimum requirements for a major, a
	// total of six (6.00) must be completed with a grade of C or higher.
	// NOTE: Ignored, because we don't store grades.

	// Only one full-course equivalent (1.00-credit course) taken S/U may
	// count toward the minimum requirements for a major. Some departments
	// have more stringent regulations.
	// NOTE: Ignored, because we don't store s/u status.

	// At least 50 percent of the minimum major must be taken through St.
	// Olaf. Students should consult the registrar and the appropriate
	// department chair or program director about counting toward a major
	// courses taken at other colleges. In addition to the registrar, the
	// chair must sign the studentâ€™s transfer of credit form (available from
	// the Office of the Registrar and Academic Advising) if work from other
	// institutions is accepted in advance. Likewise, courses taken through
	// St. Olaf off-campus programs must be approved by the chair or director
	// and the off-campus program advisor in advance if credit toward a major
	// is sought.
	// NOTE: Ignored, because this doesn't know about major requirements.
